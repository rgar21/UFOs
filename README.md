# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

Using Javascript and HTML to construct a website to display UFO sightings data

### Purpose

The intent of this project is to further build off our original website which displays UFO sightings data. In our first iteration we only included a filter that could search by date, but in our next iteration we plan to add the ability to search by city, state, country, and even UFO shape. These new improvements will aid us in our ability to navigate our dataset.

## Results

In our first iteration of this application our search capacity was very limited as we could only filter using the date. This made any extensive research efforts difficult as the user would have to comb through irrelevant data when searching for what they were looking for. We sought to make search efforts more effective by adding filters for city, state, country, and UFO shape. In our new iteration we now have five separate filters that researchers can use to find data as can be seen in the below image:

In the next image you can see how we are able to interact with our new filters by filling the state search field. The data has now been filtered to search for all reports in Texas. We also have the capacity to use different filters in combination to even further trim down our results.

## Summary

One draw back of this page is that we are unable search for states or countries using long-form input. This could potentially make it difficult for users to navigate our page as they would be have to know the short-form for the state and country they are wanting to search for. This brings me to my first recommendation for future improvements which is to add the ability to let users search using both short-form and long-form input. Adding such a capacity will make for simpler searching as the database grows. My second recommendation would be to add a result sort function which would allow users with another way to interact with search results. The ability to search by a location and then sort our results by different filter types instead of solely based on the date will allow users greater functionality.
