# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

Using Javascript and HTML to construct a website to display UFO sightings data

### Purpose

The intent of this project is to further build off our original website which displays UFO sightings data. In our first iteration we only included a filter that could search by date, but in our next iteration we plan to add the ability to search by city, state, country, and even UFO shape. These new improvements will aid us in our ability to navigate our dataset.

## Results

In our first iteration of this application our search capacity was very limited as we could only filter using the date. This made any extensive research efforts difficult as the user would have to comb through irrelevant data when searching for what they were looking for. We sought to make search efforts more effective by adding filters for city, state, country, and UFO shape. In our new iteration we now have five separate filters that researchers can use to find data as can be seen in the below image:

In the next image you can see how we are able to interact with new filters by filling the state function. The data has now been filtered to search for all reports in Texas.

allowing users to be able to enter longoform state and country, adding a survey function that can add aditional data to our dataset
